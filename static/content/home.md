Welcome on my official website. This place is dedicated to what I do on my spare time and has
nothing to do with any company nor professional purpose. You’ll find only personal-related projects
and material.

However, if you are a recruiter, you might be interested in [my portfolio](/portfolio) and/or 
contact me:

  - Via [GitHub](https://github.com/phaazon).
  - Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phaazon_).
  - Via IRC – as `phaazon`, `phz_` or similar – on:
    - Freenode
    - Mozilla
    - IRCNet
  - Via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-sabadie-97a9009b).

I don’t update the portfolio very often; I highly suggest you to have a look at my
[GitHub](https://github.com/phaazon) page for a more accurate idea of my contributions. Also, I’ve
been making special efforts to decentralize my activity, so here are a few more places where you can
find work of mine:

  - My own personal [Gitea instance](https://git.phaazon.net).
  - My [packages on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/DimitriSabadie).
  - My [crates on crates.io](https://crates.io/users/phaazon).
  - I’m also on [Gitter](https://gitter.im) as phaazon. Feel free to explore!

<h1 class="title">About me…</h1>

I’m **Dimitri Sabadie**, I’m {{age}} years old. I was born in the South-West of France, in the
neighborhood of Bordeaux. You can find me on the net as **phaazon** , **phz** or **skypers**
(old nickname).

I’ve been writing programs for a very long time. I discovered the C language when I was 12, and
started a long trek in the IT jungle. I quickly started getting more and more interested in C++ then
I wrote a few programs in C, like an .OBJ mesh file loader (shamefuly called lobj) with light and
camera support in OpenGL. A few days after lobj was released, I got my first way into the IRC world.
I found a french OpenGL channel where I was advised to transform lobj into a realtime 3D engine. I
really enjoyed my experiments with the engines I wrote. The first one was called SGLE for Skypers
OpenGL Engine, then I refactored it again and again, and finally, I ended up in the
demoscene world where I met nice people. It was also the time when I discovered the D language, a
very nice language.

I released two demoscene productions in 2013: **Lightning Road To Liquid Radiator** – a *PC Linux
64k intro* – and **Heat Station** – a *PC Windows 64k intro*, at Eersel (NL)  and Köln (DE)
respectively.

I then have a two years time learning and writing programs in **Haskell**. That period was a very
important one to me as I learned a lot about *functional programming*. I’ve been introducing myself
as a *functional programmer* since then. My **Haskell** experience taught me a lot and helped me
sharpening my mind and rigorous thoughts about software engineering, language designs and software
architectures.

After those two years, I decided to get back to writing demo productions and decided to jump in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as it’s a very well appreciated language in the **Haskell**
community. I learned the basic language in two days and the more complex concepts in a single week
(lifetime ellision, borrowing, mpsc, complex macros, uniqueness typing, etc.). My **Haskell**
experience helped a lot to get my feet wet with **Rust**. Today, I consider **Rust** as *“an
imperative Haskell”*. Less powerful in terms of abstraction, it’s better to handle memory and design
the control-flow of my programs.

I’m currently sticking around **Rust** as it fits my needs in terms of abstraction, readability,
expressiveness and minimal runtime overhead (thus runtime performance in terms of CPU and memory
footprint).

I obtained my engineer’s degree ([CTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_des_Titres_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur))
by fall 2015, delivered by [EFREI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFREI). You can download a generic
version of my CV [here](http://phaazon.net/pub/CV.pdf).

Today, I work at [vente-privee.com](http://vente-privee.com) as Functional Software Engineer. I
design and implement complex systems. Oh and I use Haskell and even Elm!
