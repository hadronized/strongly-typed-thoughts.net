  <h1>About me…</h1>

  <p>
    I’m <b>Dimitri Sabadie</b>, I’m {age}. I was born in the South-West of France, near Bordeaux. You can find me online
    as <b>hadronized</b>, <b>phaazon</b>, <b>phz</b> or even <b>skypers</b>, my old nickname.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been writing programs for a very long time. I discovered the <b>C</b> language when I was 12, and started a long
    trek in the IT jungle. As I was getting more and more interested in <b>C++</b>, I started writing few more complex
    programs, like an .OBJ mesh file loader (shamefully called <code>lobj</code>) with light and camera support in
    <b>OpenGL</b>. A few days after lobj was released, I got my first way into the IRC world. I found a French OpenGL
    channel where I was advised to transform <code>lobj</code> into a realtime 3D engine. I really enjoyed my
    experiments with the engines I wrote. The first one was called SGLE for Skypers OpenGL Engine (my old nickname being
    <em>skypers</em>), then I refactored it again and again, and finally, I ended up in the demoscene world where I met
    nice and interesting people. It was also the time when I discovered the <b>D</b> language, which I used for a bunch
    of months before eventually dropping using it. I released a couple of demoscene productions, that you can
    find <a href="https://www.pouet.net/user.php?who=93160">here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    I then had several years learning and writing programs in <b>Haskell</b> — I still am! That period was a very
    important one to me as I learned a lot about <em>functional programming</em> and especially
    <em>pure functional programming</em>. I’ve been introducing myself as a <em>functional programmer</em> ever
    since. My <b>Haskell</b> experience taught me a lot and helped me sharpening my mind and rigorous thoughts
    about software engineering, language designs and software architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    After those years, I decided to get back to writing demo productions and decided to jump in
    <b>Rust</b> as it’s a very well appreciated language in the <b>Haskell</b> community. I learned the basic language
    in two days and the more complex concepts in a week (lifetime ellision, borrowing, mpsc, complex macros, uniqueness
    typing, etc.). My <b>Haskell</b> experience helped a lot to get my feet wet with <b>Rust</b>. Today, I consider
    <b>Rust</b> as an <em>imperative Haskell</em>. Less powerful in terms of abstraction, it’s better to handle memory
    and design the control-flow of my programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently sticking around <b>Rust</b> and <b>Haskell</b> as they fit my needs in terms of abstraction,
    readability, expressiveness and minimal runtime overhead (thus runtime performance in terms of CPU and memory
    footprint), while still getting interested into learning new languages (lately, <b>Idris</b>, <b>Elm</b>, <b>Go</b>,
    modern <b>Java</b>, <b>Scala</b>, some <b>Lisp</b>, <b>PureScript</b> and a bunch of others). I don’t consider
    myself as belonging to a specific expertise field, even though I think I’m best at <em>graphics programming, code
    architecture and APIs designing</em>, and clearly <em>type-level architecture and type-system</em> coding. I have a
    wide spectrum of knowledge, ranging from <em>low-level optimization code</em>, to <em>parsers</em>, <em>compilers</em>,
    <em>EDSL</em>, <em>3D programming</em>, <em>distributed systems, high-availability, production and infrastructure</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever since, I have been working on lots of different projects on my spare time. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the
    stuff I enjoy myself with during my spare-time, if I’m not wakeboarding or playing the electric guitar:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/luminance-rs">luminance</a> ecosystem. Probably my most ambitious and
        biggest project. It’s a rendering <b>Rust</b> ecosystem gathering several crates to write safe and fast
        rendering code.
      </li>

      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/shades">shades</a> project, which is a <b>Rust EDSL</b> to write shading
        language code. Instead of writing shading code in plain old GLSL, it’s possible to write regular <b>Rust</b>
        code and get it transpiled to any kind of shading language (<b>GLSL</b>, <b>SPIR-V</b>, etc.) by using a
        <b>Rust</b> procedural proc-macro and the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/shades">shades</a>
        crate to generate the rest. It’s a very ambitious project.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/hop.nvim">hop.nvim</a>, a hinting and jump <b>Neovim</b> plugin. I created
        it a while ago against Neovim-0.5 to solve some problems of <b>EasyMotion</b> (<b>Vim</b> plugin) which wasn’t
        aware of <b>Neovim</b> capabilities (float, virtual text, etc.). The complete rewrite was at first a plugin I
        made for me but it got so much traction that it is now a well established default for Neovim motion in the
        editor community.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://this-week-in-neovim.org">https://this-week-in-neovim</a>. As the name implies,
          <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/this-week-in-neovim.org">TWiN</a> is a “this week in…” format that delivers
          readers weekly news about what happened in the Neovim ecosystem (both core and plugins). That project was pretty
          important to me as I wrote all the <b>Rust</b> code for the website and news conversion (<b>Markdown</b> to
          <b>HTML</b>), and was coordinating efforts to get weekly news and deliver them to readers, via the website or RSS feed.
        </p>

				<p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/this-week-in-neovim-contents">TWiN-contents</a> repository holds the
          actual contents of the weekly updates.
				</p>

				<p>
          Today, the project was cancelled as it drew me too much energy, and was handed over someone else from the
          community.
				</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/splines">splines</a>, a <b>Rust</b> crate I created initially for my demoscene
        needs (where I need to smoothly interpolate points in time for colors, animation, etc.). It took off and is
        now one of my most downloaded crates of all time on crates.io, summing up to almost ~411k downloads at the time of
        writing (Sep 2023). The funny story about <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/splines">splines</a> is that
        it’s used in <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Google’s Fuchsia operating system</a>!
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/glsl">glsl</a>, a <b>complete GLSL 450 / 460 Rust parser</b>. Again, I wrote it
        for my demoscene needs where I wanted to build a superset language over <b>GLSL</b>. It has also taken off, being
        used by Mozilla for its <b>Rust</b> projects (CSS rendering).
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/mind">mind</a>, the rewrite of <code>mind.nvim</code> as a standalone CLI
        and TUI set of applications. It allows to classify ideas, notes, tasks, documents and links into a tree-like
        structure.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hadronized/kak-tree-sitter">kak-tree-sitter</a>, a Unix server bridging
        <a href="https://kakoune.org">Kakoune</a> with
        <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a>. The project comprises several parts, such
        as the server itself (<code>kak-tree-sitter</code>), a controller (<code>ktsctl</code>) as well as a
        community-effort default configuration to setup the grammars and queries. The server injects highlighting and
        semantics selections into running instances of Kakoune via FIFO files and Unix sockets.
      </li>
    </ul>
