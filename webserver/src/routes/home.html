  <h1 class="title has-text-weight-normal">About me…</h1>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    I’m <b>Dimitri Sabadie</b>, I’m {age}. I was born in the South-West of France, near Bordeaux. You can find me online
    as <b>phaazon</b>, <b>phz</b> or even <b>skypers</b>, my old nickname.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been writing programs for a very long time. I discovered the C language when I was 12, and started a long
    trek in the IT jungle. I quicklystarted getting more and more interested in C++ then I wrote a few programs in C,
    like an .OBJ mesh file loader (shamefuly called lobj) with light and camera support in OpenGL. A few days after
    lobj was released, I got my first way into the IRC world. I found a French OpenGL channel where I was advised to
    transform lobj into a realtime 3D engine. I really enjoyed my experiments with the engines I wrote. The first one
    was called SGLE for Skypers OpenGL Engine, then I refactored it again and again, and finally, I ended up in the
    demoscene world where I met nice people. It was also the time when I discovered the D language, which I used for
    a bunch of months and eventually dropped using it. I released a couple of demoscene productions, that you can
    find <a href="https://www.pouet.net/user.php?who=93160">here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    I then had several years learning and writing programs in <b>Haskell</b> — I still am! That period was a very
    important one to me as I learned a lot about <em>functional programming</em> and especially
    <em>pure functional programming</em>. I’ve been introducing myself as a <em>functional programmer</em> ever
    since. My <b>Haskell</b> experience taught me a lot and helped me sharpening my mind and rigorous thoughts
    about software engineering, language designs and software architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    After those years, I decided to get back to writing demo productions and decided to jump in
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> as it’s a very well appreciated language in the <b>Haskell</b>
    community. I learned the basic language in two days and the more complex concepts in a week
    (lifetime ellision, borrowing, mpsc, complex macros, uniqueness typing, etc.). My <b>Haskell</b> experience
    helped a lot to get my feet wet with <b>Rust</b>. Today, I consider <b>Rust</b> as an <em>imperative Haskell</em>.
    Less powerful in terms of abstraction, it’s better to handle memory and design the control-flow of my programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently sticking around <b>Rust</b> and <b>Haskell</b> as they fit my needs in terms of abstraction,
    readability, expressiveness and minimal runtime overhead (thus runtime performance in terms of CPU and memory
    footprint), while still getting interested into learning new languages (lately, Idris, Elm, Go, modern Java,
    Scala, some Lisp, PureScript and a bunch of others). I don’t consider myself as belonging to a specific
    expertise field, even though I think I’m best at graphics programming, code architecture and APIs designing,
    and clearly type-level architecture and type-system coding. I have a wide spectrum of knowledge, ranging from
    low-level optimization code, to parsers, compilers, EDSL, 3D programming, distributed systems, high-availability,
    production and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever since, I have been working on lots of different projects on my spare time. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the
    stuff I enjoy myself with during my spare-time, if I’m not wakeboarding or playing the electric guitar:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs">luminance</a> ecosystem. Probably my most ambitious and
        biggest project. It’s a rendering Rust ecosystem gathering several crates to write safe and fast rendering code.
      </li>

      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/shades">shades</a> project, which is a Rust EDSL to write shading
        language code. Instead of writing shading code in plain old GLSL, it’s possible to write regular Rust code and
        get it transpiled to any kind of shading language (GLSL, SPIR-V, etc.) by using a Rust procedural proc-macro
        and the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/shades">shades</a> crate to generate the rest. It’s
        a very ambitious project.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim">hop.nvim</a>, a hinting and jump Neovim plugin. I created it a
        while ago against Neovim-0.5 to solve some problems of EasyMotion (Vim plugin) which wasn’t aware of Neovim
        capabilities (float, virtual text, etc.). The complete rewrite was at first a plugin I made for me but it got
        so much traction that it is now a well established default for Neovim motion in the editor community.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://this-week-in-neovim.org">https://this-week-in-neovim</a>. As the name implies,
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim.org">TWiN</a> is a “this week in…” format that delivers
        readers weekly news about what happened in the Neovim ecosystem (both core and plugins). That project is pretty
        important to me as I wrote all the Rust code for the website and news conversion (Markdown to HTML), and
        coordinating efforts to get weekly news and deliver them to readers, via the website or RSS feed.

        The <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/this-week-in-neovim-contents">TWiN-contents</a>repository holds the
        actual contents of the weekly updates.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/splines">splines</a>, a Rust crate I created initially for my demoscene
        needs (where I need to smoothly interpolate points in time for colors, animation, etc.). It took off and is
        now my most downloaded crates of all time on crates.io, summing up to almost ~270k downloads at the time of
        writing (Fri Jul 2022). The funny story about <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/splines">splines</a> is that
        it’s used in <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Google’s Fuchsia operating system</a>!
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/glsl">glsl</a>, a complete GLS 450 / 460 Rust parser. Again, I wrote it
        for my demoscene needs where I wanted to build a superset language over GLSL. It has also taken off, being
        used by Mozilla for its Rust projects (CSS rendering).
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/mind">mind</a>, the rewrite of <code>mind.nvim</code> as a standalone CLI
        and TUI set of applications. It allows to classify ideas, notes, tasks, documents and links into a tree-like
        structure.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/phaazon/kak-tree-sitter">kak-tree-sitter</a>, a Unix server bridging
        <a href="https://kakoune.org">Kakoune</a> with
        <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a>. The project comprises several parts, such
        as the server itself (<code>kak-tree-sitter</code>), a controller (<code>ktsctl</code>) as well as a
        community-effort default configuration to setup the grammars and queries. The server injects highlighting and
        semantics selections into running instances of Kakoune via FIFO files and Unix sockets.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h1 class="title has-text-weight-normal">Pro side</h1>

  <p>
    I obtained my engineer’s degree (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_des_Titres_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur">CTI</a>) by fall 2015, delivered by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFREI">EFREI</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I work at <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">DataDog</a> as Software Engineer. I work on distributed and
    highly available data systems.

      Disclaimer to headhunters: if you want to contact me for a job offer, please do not use a template you send to
      everyone. It’s both boring and disrespectful. Even though I used to respond to that kind of requests, I will not
      anymore. What would you think if someone applied for a job position with a template they would obviously use for
      other companies? Do you feel they would express their real interest in getting hired in your company with such a
      process? If you really want to contact me, just talk to me with your own words and read through my work.. I’m a
      human being, I don’t want to talk to a template nor being considered as “a human resource.

      Disclaimer²: I’m not interested in PHP. You  have to stop with that.
