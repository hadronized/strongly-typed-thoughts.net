It’s been two weeks [luminance](https://crates.io/crates/luminance) is at version 0.6.0. I’m very
busy currently but I decided to put some effort into making a very minimalistic yet usable sample.
The sample uses [luminance](https://crates.io/crates/luminance) and
[luminance-gl](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-gl) (the **OpenGL 3.3** backend being the single
one available for now).

You’ll find it [here](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-samples-rs/blob/master/src/main.rs).
The code is heavily commented and you can of course clone the repository and and run the executable
with cargo.

I’ll post a more detailed blog post about the application I’m building with luminance right now
later on.

Keep the vibe! :)
