# Here we are

[luminance-0.1](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/luminance-0.1) was released yesterday night,
along with [luminance-samples-0.1](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/luminance-samples-0.1)! I’ll
need to enhance the documentation and add directions so that people don’t feel too overwhelmed.

I’m also going to write a wiki to help people get their mind wrapped around **luminance**.

If you think something is missing; if you think something could be enhanced; or if you’ve found a
bug, please, feel free to fill in an issue on the
[issues tracker](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance/issues).

# Next big steps

I need to test the framework. I need a *lot* of tests. I’ll write a demoscene production with it so
that I can give a good feedback to the community and prove that **luminance** can be used and works.

In the waiting, keep the vibe!
