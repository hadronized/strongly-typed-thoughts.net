# Welcome !

Welcome on my official website. This place is dedicated to what I do on
my spare time and has nothing to do with any company nor professional
purpose. You’ll find only personal-related projects and materials.

However, if you are a recruiter, you might be interested in
[my portfolio](/portfolio) and [how to contact me](/contact).

# About me

I’m **Dimitri Sabadie**, I’m 23 years old. I was born in the South-West of
France, in the neighborhood of Bordeaux. You can find me on the net as
**phaazon** or **skypers** (old nickname). For now, I train in a company
(Essilor International) three days a week, then go to an engineer school
(EFREI) twice a week. Before that, I got a « DUT informatique », in the
university Bordeaux 1.

I’ve been writting programs for a very long time. I discovered the C language
when I was 12, and started a long trek in the IT jungle. I quickly started
getting more and more interested in C++ then I wrote a few applications in that
language, like an .OBJ mesh file loader (shamefuly called lobj) with light and
camera support in OpenGL. A few days after lobj was released, I got my first
way into the IRC world. I found a french OpenGL channel where I was advised to
transform lobj into a realtime 3D engine. I really enjoyed my experiments with
the engines I wrote. The first one was called SGLE for Skypers OpenGL Engine,
then I refactored it again and again, and finally, I ended up in the demoscene
world where I met nice people. It was also the time when I discovered the D
language, a very nice language.

Today, I write programs in Haskell and you can find all the things I want you
to see – and guess you’ll like – in the portfolio part of that website.

Enjoy your visit, and feel free to contact me!
