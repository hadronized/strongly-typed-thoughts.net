# Hosted content

## Content policy

It’s important for you to understand that I have no responsibilities about
what is hosted in [here](/browse). That is due to the fact that I am not the
only one who puts images, documents, executables or music tracks here, and I am
not a cop.

However, if I spot someone is putting any kind of file that **could be
considered as an issue**, I’ll delete it and revoke that person
any access to file hosting. Any file that satisfies the following list will be
deleted:

- file under copyright or that might violate any author related laws
    - music
    - image
    - video
    - executable
    - code
    - and so on and so forth
- any kind of pornography
- any kind of violence

If you have created something that is not pornography nor violence, you can be
sure you can host it here. However, if you want to host someone’s content,
you’ll have to ask permission for, and forward me the permission. If a I find
a file has popped out of nowhere and satisfies the above list, if I haven’t
gotten no permission, I’ll delete it.

Also, nudity and erotism are **not** pornography ;)

## Authentication

You’d like to upload some files in here? No problem, just ask me to open an
access to the file hosting for you. It’s quite simple. I would need:

- your nickname
- your wished password

When you want to upload a file, go the [upload page](/upload). If it’s your
first upload, you’ll find two inputs. Type down your nickname and password,
then login. A cookie will be created on your machine, with your nickname and a
hash of your password. That cookie will be read each time you want to upload a
file, and never expires.

After that, you will have full access to the file hosting service.

Please take note that **you don’t need to be authenticated to [browse](/browse)
the uploaded files!
